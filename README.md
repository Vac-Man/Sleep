# Sleep
To calculate healthy sleep, we need to consider the recommended sleep duration for different age groups.

In this program, you can specify your age in the age variable. The program then calculates the recommended sleep duration based on the age using the calculateRecommendedSleep() method. It returns the recommended sleep duration in hours.

Next, the calculateBedTime() method uses the current time to calculate the bedtime required to achieve the recommended sleep duration. It assumes that 8 hours of sleep is required to wake up refreshed. The method returns the calculated bedtime as a LocalTime object.

The program then outputs the recommended sleep duration and the calculated bedtime.

Please note that this is a basic example and actual sleep requirements may vary for individuals based on various factors. It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice on healthy sleep patterns.
